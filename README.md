Heroku CLI plugin for developing apps in organization accounts. Install with

    $ heroku plugins:install https://github.com/heroku/manager-cli.git
    manager-cli installed

See which orgs you are a member of:

    $ heroku manager:orgs
    You are a member of the following organizations:
        org-name-1
        org-name-2
        org-name-3
        org-name-4

Transfer an app to an org:

    $ heroku manager:transfer --app APP_NAME --to ORG_NAME

*Example:*

    $ heroku manager:transfer --app hollow-warrior-3022 --to org-name-1
    Transferring hollow-warrior-3022 to org-name-1...done

Check the app after the transfer:

    $ heroku info --app hollow-warrior-3022
    === hollow-warrior-3022
